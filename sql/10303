ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

<fraud_score>
policy_num:    varchar
state:         varchar
claim_cost:    int
fraud_score:   float

/*

SELECT policy_num, state, claim_cost, fraud_score
FROM(
    SELECT *,
        PERCENT_RANK() over(partition BY state ORDER BY fraud_score DESC) as pctl
    FROM fraud_score) as data
WHERE pctl <=0.05
