IBM is working on a new feature to analyze user purchasing behavior for all Fridays in the first quarter of the year. 
For each Friday separately, calculate the average amount users have spent per order. The output should contain the week number of that Friday and average amount spent.

Table: user_purchases

user_id:         int
date:            datetime
amount_spent:    float
day_name:        varchar

*/

SELECT WEEk(date) as week_number_Friday,
    AVG(amount_spent) as avg_Friday_spent
FROM user_purchases
WHERE day_name = "Friday" 
GROUP BY week_number_Friday
