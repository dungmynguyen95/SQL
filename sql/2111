/*

Write a query to return Territory and corresponding Sales Growth. Compare growth between periods Q4-2021 vs Q3-2021.
If Territory (say T123) has Sales worth $100 in Q3-2021 and Sales worth $110 in Q4-2021, then the Sales Growth will be 10% [ i.e. = ((110 - 100)/100) * 100 ]
Output the ID of the Territory and the Sales Growth. Only output these territories that had any sales in both quarters.
